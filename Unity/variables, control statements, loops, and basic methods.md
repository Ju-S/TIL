# unity  
## Variables, ControlStatements, and Loops  
unity's variables, control statements, loops is just like [C#](https://github.com/Ju-S/TIL/CSharp)  

## Basic Methods  
`print` is just print some text in unity console.  
`void Start() {  }` is start when game is start.  
`void Update() {  }` is infinite loop when during a game is running.  
`Input.GetAxis ("Hroizontal or Vertical")` is get axis of object that running in game.  
`Vector3.normalized` is normalizing the vector.  
`[RequireComponent (type of (some component name))]` is create component in this object if not it have component that `type of (component)` code.  
`GetCompnent<component>` is import information of component in object.  
`Time.deltaTime` is time between previous frame and current frame.  
`RigidBody.MovePosition(Vector3)` is move the object to rigidBody + vector3. RigidBody.MovePosition is has some different with transform.position and RigidBody.position. RigidBody.MovePosition is push the other RigidBody when RigidBody is move to calculated position.
